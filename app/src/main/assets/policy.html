Our App is designed with your privacy in mind, functioning without the need to collect or process any personal data from its users.

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

<h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    As we do not collect any personal data, there is no information to use, share, or disclose. Our policy ensures that there are no third-party affiliations or data sharing agreements. The App is free from advertisements and does not connect to social networks or other external services that could compromise your privacy.
</p>
<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    Our commitment to maintaining a data-free App means that this Privacy Policy will only undergo changes if there are significant updates to our practices or as required by law. Any changes will be posted on our website and within the App, becoming effective immediately upon their posting.
